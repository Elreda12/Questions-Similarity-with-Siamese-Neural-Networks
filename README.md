# Questions-Similarity-with-Siamese-Neural-Networks
# Objective :
The objective of this project is to build a system for learning question similarity with Siamese Neural 
Networks. Question retrieval task has recently received wide interest especially with the development 
of platforms like Quora and Stackoverflow. Then, checking if a similar question has already been posed 
and answered by the community is very important for the end users.
# Data :
The data to be used for training and testing is Quora Question Pairs Dataset. This dataset can be
downloaded from this link:
http://qim.fs.quoracdn.net/quora_duplicate_questions.tsv
# Description :
The architecture of the system is described in the paper cited in the reference, and its schema is depicted 
in figure 1. The system will be tested only for English, even if the paper is also concerned with Arabic.

This project is based on the implementation of work performed by the authors of the paper cited in the 
reference, but you can extend it with your personal ideas.
# Deliverable :
Code repository: Jupyter notebook including in plus of the code explanations about your methods and 
algorithms.
